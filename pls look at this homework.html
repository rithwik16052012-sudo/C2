<H1>Welcome To Delhi Public School, Rewari</H1>
<H2>At DPS Rewari, we believe that education transcends the mere acquisition of knowledge. It is a journey of self-discovery, a process that enables curiosity, nurtures creativity, and cultivates a deep sense of empathy. Our mission is to guide the young minds entrusted to us towards a wholesome growth; physically, mentally, emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually.

We celebrate diversity, cultivating an enriched culture of sharing, service, trust, and pride. We believe that true education generates the desire to serve others, improve our world, and give willingly in order to truly receive. Our motto, "Service Before Self," is proudly emblazoned on the DPS Society emblem, reflecting our core values and dedication to nurturing socially responsible global citizens.</H2>    
<h1>From the Desk of the Director</h1>
<h2>“The true purpose of education is not merely to inform the mind, but to shape the whole individual.”

It is this enduring maxim that underpins the educational philosophy of Delhi Public School, Rewari.

Education, in its purest essence, transcends the transmission of information; it is the thoughtful nurturing of intellect, character, and purpose. At DPS Rewari, we are committed to fostering a learning environment where academic excellence is harmoniously integrated with ethical values, social awareness, and a deep sense of responsibility.

Situated in a serene and expansive setting, away from the intensity of urban congestion, the school is strategically located along the highway, offering excellent connectivity while maintaining a calm, secure, and enriching campus environment. This focused and tranquil setting encourages curiosity, reinforces discipline, and nurtures independent thought—qualities that enable students to navigate the complexities of a dynamic world.

Our academic endeavour rests on rigour, relevance, and responsiveness to change. A thoughtfully designed curriculum, supported by technology-enhanced classrooms and inquiry-driven pedagogy, equips learners with critical thinking abilities, adaptability, and intellectual resilience. The consistent and commendable performance of our students in the Class X and XII Board Examinations, along with their successful admission to leading institutions across the country, stands as a testament to our sustained commitment to excellence and purposeful mentoring.

Beyond academics, we place equal emphasis on holistic development. Sports, cultural pursuits, leadership programmes, and community engagement are integral to school life, fostering teamwork, accountability, emotional intelligence, and empathy. Celebrations of cultural festivals, experiential excursions, and cherished school traditions further enrich this journey, creating an atmosphere of joy, belonging, and lifelong learning. Learning at DPS Rewari therefore extends beyond classrooms, shaping well-rounded individuals through lived experience.

“Education is a shared responsibility, not a solitary pursuit.”

In this spirit, we value our parents as trusted stakeholders in the educational journey. Inspired by the guiding principle of “Service Before Self,” we endeavour to nurture young individuals who embody competence with conscience, ambition with humility, and knowledge with wisdom.

At Delhi Public School, Rewari, we prepare students not only for careers, but for citizenship—for lives marked by integrity, purpose, and meaningful contribution to society.

With commitment and conviction,

Dr. Kavita Mathur
Director</h2>
